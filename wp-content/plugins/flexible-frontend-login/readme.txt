= How to use the Flexible Frontend Login shortcode on your site =

On the widget settings page choose the Flexible Frontend Login and adjust the settings to your site.

In a post or page place __`[flexible-frontend-login]`__ 

By default the shortcode uses the settings set on the admin options page

You can override those default values with the following parameters and options:

* `vertical=top, bottom`
* `horizontal=left, right`

So your shortcode might look like this:

* __`[flexible-frontend-login vertical=bottom horizontal=left]`__

If you want to use the centered login form with darkened overlay in the background
use __`[flexible-frontend-login-modal]`__ without any parameters.


= How to use the Flexible Frontend Login template tag on your site =

In template files place:

 __`<?php if ( function_exists('flexible_frontend_login') ) flexible_frontend_login( 'bottom', 'left' ); ?>`__

To change popups behavior you can use

* "bottom" or "top"
* "left" or "right"

For popup with overlay use: 

 __`<?php if ( function_exists('flexible_frontend_login_modal') ) flexible_frontend_login_modal(); ?>`__
 

= Live examples =

* For more examples see [plugin's website](http://www.flexibleplugins.com/frontend-login/)

= How to add your own styling =

1. Place a folder `flexible-frontend-login` in your theme folder
1. Copy the files from `/wp-content/plugins/flexible-frontend-login/customization/` into the newly created theme subfolder
1. Adjust the CSS to your theme. You'll find all classes provided by the plugin in that file.
1. If necessary change the HTML markup in the template file.
